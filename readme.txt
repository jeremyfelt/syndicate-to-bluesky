Quite a bit of inspiration and much of the initial code was forked from the [Share on Bluesky plugin](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-share-on-bluesky), which is licensed as GPLv2 **and** [available on the WordPress.org repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/share-on-bluesky/).

A big thank you to Matthias Pfefferle, you should probably use that plugin and ignore my experimentations. üòÅ
